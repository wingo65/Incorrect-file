                <p>A paragraph review of <en>The Spoongebob SquarePants Movie </en></p>
                <p>The Spongebob SquarePants Movie is honeslty one of my most favorite movies of all time, not only does it contain a lot of nostalgia for me but what how well the directors executed this movie.</p>
                <p>The attention to detail to this movie is truly amazing considering it came out in 2004, you would think that it came out way later than that. What also makes this a great movie is that the story line for this movie is truly amazing, King neptune gets his crown stolen by plankton who framed Mr.Krabs for it and Spongebob and Patrick both decide to team up in order to save the bikini bottom from plankton and his minions he has created including King Neptune.</p>
