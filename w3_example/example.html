            <p>My name is Nicholas Elkhaouli. I am 20 years old and currently enrolled at New England Tech. My goal in college is to achieve my bachelor's 
                degree and hopefully get a job at Google, Amazon or whoever decides to hire me. I lived in Rhode Island my entire life, I first lived in Pawtucket where 
                my family and I lived there for about 5 years and then moved to Cranston where is where I've been ever since.</p>
